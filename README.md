## :dart: About ##

Cool keeper is the modern password manager we have been looking for. Built using the latest technologies from the web development world, it's goal is to provide the users a safe place to store their passwords with a great UX and beautiful UI (work in progress). The idea is to achieve this by building a highly interactive open source environment where people can contribute adding features and fixing bugs.
